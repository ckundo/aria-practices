## Contributing to this Repository

### Code conformance

* All code should validate in the NU HTML Validator.
Exceptions to this rule are warnings and errors related to
future ARIA features we need to implement.
* To keep code in this repository consistent; editors should use a text editor
that supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).

### Writing code examples

- Choose a pattern from the
  [Design Patterns Status](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Design-Patterns-Status)
  document that is missing a code example.
- Via the command line, run:

        $ bin/generate <name>

  Where `<name>` is the camel-cased name of the design pattern example. This
  creates a new example directory and file with the same name, based on a
  template.

- Edit the new html file with an example corresponding to the description in
  `aria-practices.html`

### Editorial documentation

General documentation for editing ARIA deliverables is available in the 
[ARIA repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).
Some of that documentation covers technical procedures not needed 
for this specification.
